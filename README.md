# This script uses the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto.

# For more information on the data see: www.smartlab.ws

# This script merges together the training and testing observations of the accelerometer, and shows averages for each variable.
# The first variable, subject, gives the subject identifier. It includes subjects from training and testing.
# The second variable, activity, gives the activity that the subject engaged in for this observation.
# The remainder of the variables are the averages of means and standard deviations for all data points, by the subject specified in the first variable, doing the activity specified in the second variable.
